General opinion
+ interesting intro
- should be compiled in the future to reduce size of download
- esc to run? shift would be more natural, same goes for menu esc to open up the menu feels better
+ items in the bins are nice, haven't seen that in a while
+ Pokémon running around in the wild, is a nice detail
- balancing feels off a bit
+ good music
- loops from the music could be better though
- encounter rate is a bit high
- steamtree forest double battle could be rebalanced a bit, that Syther can one shot Pokémon on the same level with Acrobats

Quality of life suggestions
- maybe add that you don't need to listen to all the talking after a loss in battle
- Consistency in menu operation, needs shift to open up menu, but can leave with esc
- IV/EV view in Pokémon menu?
- add that the selection on which Pokémon is attacking who in double battle stays where it was the round before
- maybe add a sort of quest book to look up on what to do
- move the route 1 healing ranger to a different position as the center is rather close
- early xp share for easier leveling would be nice

Visual Bugs:
- Commonwealth cave, exit Mulberry, sprite layering is wrong
- After beating ranger blocking route 1, and heading back to the Center, the Rangers Sprite is back in position to block the way, interactable also when standing atop the sprite.
- first flower beneath the route 1 entrance, sprite layering is wrong
- animations in double battle, and catching Pokémon are a bit offset
- Steamtree ranger sprite is a train conducter sprite
- the fog in steamtree forest, disappears after battle, before reappearing shortly after
- west side of the route 1 bridge flickers sometimes while walking south

Audio Bugs:
- Leaving a battle while the win music is playing, pauses the map music longer, leaving silence for a while
- normal effective attacks don't play a sound on hit

Bugs:
- actual grass tiles are also placed above the flower patches
- Route 1 exit Steam tree forest, sign is readable when collecting the item behind
